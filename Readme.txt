The Game Itself

Memory Mystery is a text based game that attempts to adapt a few scenes from a high fantasy book I am in the process of writing.
Thus, a lot of the content makes much more sense if you know the context behind it. This is the point. The game is supposed to be
a little confusing at times as this reflects the main characters mindstate. ChatGPT or other similar tools were NOT used in the creation
of this game.

There is a lot I want to add to this game, for example, an actual magic system, craving system and more methods. Additionally, the luminous fox creature will be made a supposed to be an entity in itself that could move around and do things and the same thing goes for the pheonix's as well. This is
why it might seem a bit funny that you can run into some areas that supposedly hold dangerous creatureS within them (the Phoenix's) but neither the player nor the creature
can do anything to each other.

P.s. sorry for the long passages of text --> for the bad ending enter full screen mode in the GUI.
